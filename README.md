# INGInious-C-Tutor (UCL-EPL 2015-2016)
This is the code of the tool used to build extended feedbacks on the students submissions for the INGInious platform developed at UCL.
The tool was developed in the context of my Master thesis. It was originally forked from the Github [opt-cpp-backend project](https://github.com/pgbovine/opt-cpp-backend) of pgbovine.

This project is intended to be used inside the [INGInious](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious) platform. A sample `run` file is provided in this repository in order to show how to use the tool inside INGInious tasks. This `run` file is similar to the `run` files described in the [INGInious documentation](http://inginious.readthedocs.io/en/latest/teacher_doc/run_file.html).
The tool could also be used with an arbitrary C program. However, the feedback pages are located on a web-server reachable from the INGI department of UCL. That is a temporary solution.
